Group 18 Project Repository - R for Bio Data Science 2023 🧬📊

Description:
Our project focuses on the analysis of the dataset derived from the research article by Martin et al. (2019) titled "Incidence and Morbidity of Radiation-Induced Hemorrhagic Cystitis in Prostate Cancer." This study, published in the Urology journal, explores the occurrence and impact of radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis in prostate cancer patients. The associated dataset, published by Sarah Martin in 2021 on Mendeley Data, provides a valuable resource for our group to analyse and to try to reproduce the research findings.
