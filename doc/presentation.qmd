# Introduction

-   Prostate cancer is a major global health concern.
-   Radiation therapy, a common treatment, can lead to complications like hemorrhagic cystitis (HC).
-   HC symptoms include bleeding and bladder pain.
-   A 15-year study with 739 patients examined the impact of different radiotherapy types on HC development.
-   We will explore data processes, analyses, and insights gained from this study.

# Data

Our project involved extensive data preparation, including cleaning and augmenting our dataset. Here's a glimpse into the process:

# Clean

`janitor`

`dplyr`

`stringr`

`tidyverse`

`lubridate`

## *dat_load1*

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
`clean_names()`: Simplifies and standardizes variable names

`mutate()`:Transforms or adds new variables

`ymd()`: Parse strings to dates

`str_replace_all()`: Replaces all pattern matches in the string

`as.numeric()`: Converts values to numeric

`ifelse()` : Conditional logic returns two alternatives
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: space-below
``` {.r code-line-numbers="2"}
dat_load1 <- dat_load1 |> 
  clean_names()
```
:::

``` {.r code-line-numbers="2,5,8,9,11,15"}
dat_load1 <- dat_load1 |> 
  mutate(
  
    # Make variable type as Date
    date_of_birth = ymd(date_of_birth),
    
    # ethnicity - make all names lower case, change AA to african american
    ethnicity = ifelse(ethnicity == "AA", "african_american", tolower(ethnicity)),
    
    # radiation_dosage - remove characters "Gy" make the observatons as num
    radiation_dosage =  str_replace_all(radiation_dosage, "Gy", ""),
    radiation_dosage = round(as.numeric(radiation_dosage),2),
    
    # comorbidities add "," to allow separation by ",", str_replace did not work
    comorbidities = ifelse(row_number() == 2, "HTN, A. fib, DM, CHF, tobacco", comorbidities)
```
:::
:::

## *dat_load2 & dat_load3*

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
`select()`: Selects specific variables

`rename()`: Renames variables

`pivot_longer()`: Manipulation of data from a wide to longer format

`distinct()`: Removes duplicate rows from the data
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: space-below
``` {.r code-line-numbers="2,8"}
dat_load2 <- dat_load2 |> 
  select(-rads_for_prostate_primary, 
         -rads_bladder_primary, 
         -developed_bladder_first,
         -developed_prostate_first)

dat_load2 <- dat_load2 |>
  rename(bladder = "bladder_ca")
```
:::

``` {.r code-line-numbers="2,6"}
combined_dat_load2_load3 <- combined_dat_load2_load3 |>
  pivot_longer(cols = ebrt:brachytherapy,
              names_to = "treatment", 
              values_to = "values",
              values_drop_na = TRUE) |>
  distinct(hospital_id, .keep_all = TRUE) |>
  select(-values)
```
:::
:::

# Augment

`dplyr`

`stringr`

## *dat_clean1*

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
`sapply()`: Applies a function over a list or vector with a simple output.

`relocate()`: Rearranges columns in the data set.

`str_count()`: Counts the number of matches to a pattern in each string of a vector

`strplit()`: Splits string into a list of sub-strings (not sure if it should be here).
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: space-below
``` {.r code-line-numbers="4,5"}
dat_clean1 <- dat_clean1 |>       
  mutate(los_for_each_admission = ifelse(is.na(los_for_each_admission), 0,    
                                         los_for_each_admission),     
         num_days_admitted = sapply(los_for_each_admission, sum_values)) |>   
  relocate(num_days_admitted, .after = los_for_each_admission) 
```
:::

``` {.r code-line-numbers="3"}
dat_clean1 <- dat_clean1 |>   
  mutate(num_hosp_complications = ifelse(is.na(hospitalization_complications), 0,     
                                         str_count(hospitalization_complications, pattern = ",") + 1)) |>        
  relocate(num_hosp_complications, .after = hospitalization_complications)

# Analysis 1

-   Key insights include BMI and radiation dose relationships, dose percentages, and time-related comparisons.

-   We also explored survival probabilities and key variable distributions among patients who developed HC.

-   Libraries: `ggplot2`

# Analysis 2

-   Visualized PCA outcomes through a biplot, categorizing data by cancer type to identify patterns across different cancers.
-   Developed a linear regression model examining the relationship between age at radiation, comorbidity count, and hospitalization duration.
-   Libraries: `ggplot2`, `purrr`, `cowplot`, `broom`

# Conclusion

The analysis provided valuable insights for understanding prostate cancer radiation treatment and HC development.

R Studio, together with `ggplot2`, converts data into concise, understandable visuals. `tidyverse` and `dplyr` make data manipulation easier while `stringr` simplifies text analysis.

Together, these tools significantly improve the clarity and communication of research findings.
