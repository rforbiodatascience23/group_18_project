## Introduction

-   Prostate cancer is a major global health concern.
-   Radiation therapy, a common treatment, can lead to complications like hemorrhagic cystitis (HC).
-   HC symptoms include bleeding and bladder pain.
-   Our 15-year study with 709 patients examines the impact of different radiotherapy types on HC development.
-   We'll explore data processes, analyses, and insights gleaned from this extensive study.

## Data

Our study involved extensive data preparation, including cleaning and augmenting our dataset. Here's a glimpse into our process:

## Describe

## Analysis 1: Patient Distribution and Key Variables

-   We analyzed two datasets (*`analysis_1.1`* and *`analysis_1.2`*).

-   Key insights include BMI and radiation dose relationships, dose percentages, and time-related comparisons.

-   We also explored survival probabilities and key variable distributions among patients who developed HC.

## Discussion

-   Our study unveils potential underreporting in HC cases, despite advancements in radiation therapy.
-   Limitations include its retrospective nature and focus on the Detroit region.
-   These findings provide valuable insights, informing future medical practices and research.

## Conclusion

Thank you for attending our presentation. We hope our study's insights contribute to better understanding and management of HC in prostate cancer treatment. Any questions or discussions are welcome.
