## (Slide 1): Introduction

-   Prostate cancer is a major global health concern.

-   Radiation therapy is a common treatment but can lead to complications like hemorrhagic cystitis (HC).

-   HC symptoms include bleeding and bladder pain.

-   15-year study with 709 patients examines the impact of different radiotherapy types on HC development.

-   Graphical representation of your process going from raw to analysis-ready data

**##Materials and Methods**

## (Slide 2): Clean

```{r}
#| eval: false

#Load the libraries, which won't show in the slides
cat(readLines("~/group_18_project/R/00_all_libraries.qmd"), sep = "\n")

#need to use source in stead of cat here to run it
```

```{r}
#| eval: false

#Load the data, which won't show in the slides
cat(readLines("~/group_18_project/R/01_load.qmd"), sep = "\n")

#need to use source in stead of cat here to run it
```

```{r}

#same here, first source and then cat to show the file
#load the clean file
cat(readLines("~/group_18_project/R/02_clean.qmd"), sep = "\n")
```

## (Slide 3): Clean

## (Slide 4): Augment

```{r}
#load the augment file
cat(readLines("~/group_18_project/R/04_augment.qmd"), sep = "\n")
```

## (Slide 5): Analysis 1

-   Load two datasets (**`analysis_1.1`** and **`analysis_1.2`**) from TSV files.

-   Insights into the distribution of patients with HC, relationships between variables:

    BMI and radiation dose, dose percentages, time-related comparisons, survival probabilities, and the distribution of key variables among patients who developed HC.

## **(Slide 11): Discussion**

Unveiling potential underreporting in healthcare cases despite radiation therapy advancements. Study limitations include its retrospective nature and regional focus on Detroit, cautioning broad extrapolation. Nevertheless, our findings offer valuable insights, shaping future medical considerations.
