## (Slide 1): Introduction

\- Prostate cancer is a major global health concern.

\- Radiation therapy is a common treatment but can lead to complications like hemorrhagic cystitis (HC).

\- HC symptoms include bleeding and bladder pain.

\- A 15-year study with 709 patients examines the impact of different radiotherapy types on HC development.

## (Slide 3): Clean

## (Slide 4): Augument

## (Slide 5): Analysis 1

-   Load two datasets (**`analysis_1.1`** and **`analysis_1.2`**) from TSV files.

-   Insights into the distribution of patients with HC, relationships between variables:

    BMI and radiation dose, dose percentages, time-related comparisons, survival probabilities, and the distribution of key variables among patients who developed HC.
